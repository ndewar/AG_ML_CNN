Python, gdal, earth engine, tensorflow environment install setup

# Commands to duplicate this environment

# Prerequisite: Anaconda 2, python 2.x

# First make sure you're using python2.x
vi ~/. bash profile
'''
Comment out python 3 path
uncomment python 2 path
close all terminal windows and re open
run "which python" or "python --v" to ensure python 2.x is running
'''

# Make a conda virtualenv

conda create --name machine_learning_python2 --clone 2015-geospatial # clone from a previous environment loaded with gdal


source activate machine_learning_python2

# Now you should see (machine_learning_python2) prepended to your terminal prompt

Create adn go to a folder
mkdir /Users/aakashahamed/Desktop/machine_learning/FP
cd /Users/aakashahamed/Desktop/machine_learning/FP

# Libs	
pip install 'pyOpenSSL>=0.11'

pip install earthengine-api

python -c "import ee; ee.Initialize()" # see that the install works

earthengine authenticate # and supply ee credentials

# Install tensorflow - instructions from here: https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_mac#the_url_of_the_tensorflow_python_package

pip install --ignore-installed --upgrade \
 https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/mac/cpu/tensorflow-1.4.0-py2-none-any.whl

# validate the install - enter python shell (type "python") and do the following:
# Python
import tensorflow as tf
hello = tf.constant('Hello, TensorFlow!')
sess = tf.Session()
print(sess.run(hello))

# If "Hellow Tensorflow" prints to the terminal you're good

# Now install gdal and osgeo
conda install -c conda-forge gdal
